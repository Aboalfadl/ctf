In general, most of our team did not like this particular CTF. The amount of points given for tasks was rarely corresponding
to its difficulty - we spent a lot of time without effects on some 100pt tasks, only to solve 500pt one in a couple of 
minutes afterwards. The tasks themselves were quite repetitive. Organization was terrible - servers were down often
and there were errors in problems.

One of the worst things was that there was no flag format at all - we could have the flag right in front of our eyes 
and not realize it. Perhaps the most drastic examples was one of the web tasks, in which we managed to get source code
of the website, containing references to `/var/www/html/flag` - so we spent a lot of time trying various things to get
that file. But for some reason, organizers thought it was more appropriate to make the flag md5 hash given right in
the source...
